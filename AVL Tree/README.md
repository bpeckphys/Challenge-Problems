AVL tree:

The challenge is to construct an AVL tree in Java with the following operations:
1.	Insert
2.	Delete
3.	Find (Boolean return)
4.	Clear All

An AVL tree is a Binary Search Tree with the following properties:
1.	The difference in height of the right and left tree cannot be more than 1
2.	If, after an operation, there is a difference of more than 1 in the height of the right and left subtrees, then you must refactor the tree so that principle 1 remains true
