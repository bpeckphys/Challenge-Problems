Recipe Book
The challenge is to return a recipe from a recipe book that best uses the ingredients in your pantry. 
You are given a recipe book ( Set<Map<String, Double>> ) that has a list of recipes. 
Each Recipe contains ingredients and how much of it you have. 
You are also given your Pantry ( Map<String, Double> ) which contains ingredients and how much of it you have.

For this challenge, the “best” recipe is the one that uses the most “unique” ingredients.
